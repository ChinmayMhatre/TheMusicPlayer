## **Here's a quick rundown on how to make a contribution to my project:**

---

<br>

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.

   <br>

2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub account. This means that you will have a copy of the repository `underyour-GitHub-username/repository-name.`

   <br>

3. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
   ```

4. Add the upstream remote:

   ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ChinmayMhatre/TheMusicPlayer.git
   ```

5. Pull the latest changes from the main repository if you think your fork is behind:

   ```
   git pull upstream master
   ```

6. Next install npm and run the script to start the server.

   ```
   npm install

   npm run dev
   ```

7. Create a new branch and switch to it for your issue fix or feature using:

   ```
   git switch -c branch-name-here
   ```

8. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add

   <br>

9. Add the changes to the staging are and commit them to the branch you are working on

   <br>

10. Push the changes to the remote repository using:

```
git push origin branch-name-here
```

11. Submit a **pull request** to the upstream repository

   <br>

12. Title the **pull request** with a short description of the changes made

   <br>

13. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer

   <br>

14. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them

   <br>

15. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
